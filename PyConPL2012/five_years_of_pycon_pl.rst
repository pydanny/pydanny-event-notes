Introduction
=============

* We've been doing PyCon PL for 5 years
* How many people have been to PyCon before? (about half)
* How many people have come to their first PyCon?  (about half)

How did we get started?
===============================


* The inspiration comes from various other user group conferences.
* We wanted an event for Python 
* Piotr got credit and applause for his untiring work in the Polish Python community. Many attendees are previous students of his.
* We also give credit to PLUG (Polish Linux User Group)
