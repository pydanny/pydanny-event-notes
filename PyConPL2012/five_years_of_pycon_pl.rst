.. note:: I'm translating this entire talk from Polish.
    I don't speak Polish except how to say, "Thanks" and now "Questions?".

Introduction
=============

* We've been doing PyCon PL for 5 years
* How many people have been to PyCon before? (about half)
* How many people have come to their first PyCon?  (about half)

How did we get started?
===============================


* The inspiration comes from various other user group conferences.
* We wanted an event for Python 
* We also give credit to PLUG (Polish Linux User Group)
* Piotr Kasprzyk, Ph.D, gets credit and applause for his untiring work in the Polish Python community. Many attendees are previous students of his and he invited Audrey Roy to PyCon PL 2012.
