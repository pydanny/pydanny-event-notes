Talk Description
================

Timekeeping on all levels is surprisingly difficult. This talk explains why it's sort hard, and which parts Python can help you with.

* What is calendaring, really, and why is it so complex?
* What's in a year?
* Dissecting the Julian/Gregorian calendar
* Mesopotamian mathematics
* Time zones
* Recurring events is less fun than you think.

Introduction
==============

.. epigraph:: The problem with calendaring is that it is based off of multiple cycles that don't work well with each other

**Rome:** They had a 10 month calendar that made winter a dead period in the calendar. Eventually they added January and February

Lunar Calendars
=================

* The year is twelve lunar months long.
* The year is out of sync with the seasons
* Example: The Islamic Calendar

Lunisolar calendars
=====================

* The year is 12 or 13 months long
* The year is kept in sync with season by leap months
* examples

    * Hebrew
    * Buddhist

Solar Calendars
=================
    
.. epigraph:: The villain of the story is Caesar

* The year follows the solstices/seasons
* The moon is ignored completely
* Examples:

    * French republican
    * Julian Calendar

Thanks to the success of the Roman Empire Europe takes a weird Solar calendar, and thanks to the success of Europe, the world takes it on too.
