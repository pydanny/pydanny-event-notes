Description
============

What happens when you take a Python developer and immerse her completely in JavaScript for a few weeks? This talk tells the story of my journey through JavaScript, from deep-diving in and looking for Python analogues in JS to achieving a greater understanding and appreciation of Python's design through comparative language study.

.. note:: Spent the talk taking pictures. Waiting for some notes taken by others that I'll be including here.
