August 14, 2012 - Rebuilding DoubleClick with AngularJS
============================================================

* At Google San Francisco
* Talk about converting Double Click Advertising UI to AngularJS

Old app
============================

* DFA6 FE was C# on ASP.NET
* DFA6 BE was Java on Oracle


New App - challenges
=====================

* Rebuild DFA using technologies that made more sense for Google.

    * Engineering skills
    * Google tech backends
    
* GWT or not?

    * Principal UI technology across Google advertising products
    * No resources on their team familiar with it
    * Hard to find engineers with GWT
    
Other tools they considered

    * Backbone.js
    * JavaScriptMVC
    * others

Enter AngularJS

    * It was declarative
    * Had two-way data binding
    * Used plan old JavaScript objects
    * Happily integrated with JQuery
    * It had a full testing story
    * It had a straightforward architectural model
    
Transition to prototype
=========================

* One engineer created a basic prototype in two days.

    * Used existing web services and CSS
    * 10% time spent compared to GWT
    * 10% of the size of code base
    
Transition to AngularJS
========================

* Early Strategy: Upgrade the app page-by-page
* Eventual Strategy: Rewrote the app from scratch

Their AngularJS strategy caused a lot of FUD:

* Why weren't they using GWT?
* AngularJS maintained by less than 5 people.
