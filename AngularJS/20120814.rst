============================================================

* At Google San Francisco
* Case study about use of AngularJS for DoubleClick

.. pull-quote:: Meetup Description

    This month we'll have a very special guest speaker - Marc Jacobs, tech lead of the DoubleClick Digital Marketing Manager team in NYC. If you want to get first hand info about building a large enterprise app with AngularJS, this is the meetup for you!

    This presentation will be done over video-conference (from Mountain View) and attendees are encouraged to ask questions and join the discussion over the video link. Additionally, one or two AngularJS core team members will be present on site and can answer questions locally as well.

Old app
============================

* DFA6 FE was C# on ASP.NET
* DFA6 BE was Java on Oracle


New App - challenges
=====================

* Rebuild DFA using technologies that made more sense for Google.

    * Engineering skills
    * Google tech backends
    
* GWT or not?

    * Principal UI technology across Google advertising products
    * No resources on their team familiar with it
    * Hard to find engineers with GWT
    
Other tools they considered

    * Backbone.js
    * JavaScriptMVC
    * others

Enter AngularJS

    * It was declarative
    * Had two-way data binding
    * Used plan old JavaScript objects
    * Happily integrated with JQuery
    * It had a full testing story
    * It had a straightforward architectural model
    
Transition to prototype
=========================

* One engineer created a basic prototype in two days.

    * Used existing web services and CSS
    * 10% time spent compared to GWT
    * 10% of the size of code base
    
Transition to AngularJS
========================

* Early Strategy: Upgrade the app page-by-page
* Eventual Strategy: Rewrote the app from scratch

Their AngularJS strategy caused a lot of FUD:

* Why weren't they using GWT?
* AngularJS maintained by less than 5 people.

Google got over the FUD and now embrace AngularJS.

Single Page Architecture
==========================

Issues:

* Common view content
* bookmarkability
* JQuery

Other libraries they use
============================

* Underscore.js
* Closure
* LESS
* HTML5 Boilerplate
