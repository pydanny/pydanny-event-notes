Introduction to OpenStack
=========================

By Jonathon LaCour

    * Experienced 15 years with Python
    * Dreamhost lead developer
    * Teaches high level Python classes too

Let's talk about cloud
----------------------

* The term *cloud* has been ruined
* ground rules:

    * Cloud - elastic infrastructure providing compute, network, and storage via well-defined APIs
    
    * Public cloud - A multi-tenant, publicly available cloud where resources are metered and billed as a utility, and any entity can place workloads.
    
        * Often makes money by charging monthly or service fees
        
    * Private cloud - A privately owned cloud generally used by a single organization for one or more applications
    
What is OpenStack?
-------------------

* OpenStack is a cloud operating system or cloud management system
* Use it to build public or private clouds

    * VMs
    * Volumes
    * Multi-tenancy
    * APIS - well defined and documented
    
History of OpenStack
---------------------

* 2008 - NASA creates Nebula
* 2009 - Rackspace creates Swift
* 2010 - OpenStack is born!

.. note:: My last few months at NASA we were begging and pleading for the right to use Nebula so we didn't have to deal with standard NASA server provisioning which is both time intensive 

Components of OpenStack
------------------------

Nova
~~~~

    * OpenStack's Compute controller, originally created by NASA
    * Communicates with the hypervisor to create/destroy VMs
    * "Schedules"where VMs are created
    * Originally handled network and storage allocation
    * RESTful API
    
Swift
~~~~~

    * Object storage system created by Rackspace
    * Highly available, distributed, and eventually consistent
    * RESTful APIs - S3 and Swift
    * Can be swapped out for Ceph, a unified distributed storage system created at Dreamhost
    
Cinder
~~~~~~~~~~
    
    * OpenStack's block storage as a service platform
    * Enables the creation of block devices via API that can be attached to VMs
    * Spun out from Nova during the latest release cycle
    * RESTful APIs
    
Glance
~~~~~~~~~~

    * OpenStack's image service
    * Provides services for discovering, registering, and retrieving VM images
    * Integrates with Ceph to enable Copy-on-write (COW) for fast VM creation
    * RESTful APIs
    
Quantum
~~~~~~~~~~

* OpenStack's networking-as-a-service layer
* Replaces the networking services originally in Nova
* Supports the concepts of complex virtual networks, including isolation from other tenants in the cloud
* L2 services currently supported and some L3 services currently deployed

Keystone
~~~~~~~~

* General identify framework for OpenStack

Horizon
~~~~~~~

* Django based user interface
* Provides web based interface to all the above components

Parts you may want to add to OpenStack
------------------------------------------------

* Routing
* VPN
* load balancing
* Firewall
* Metering system

    * Way to monetize OpenStack!
    * Ceilometer is an open source version: https://github.com/stackforge/ceilometer
    
* Billing

Commercial options are available - and open source options are being authored:

.. note:: Why I like OpenStack is that you have good control over your server provisioning. If a vendor doesn't play nice, you can move your stack or deploy on your own servers.
