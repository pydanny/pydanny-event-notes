Problems he wants to solve in Caller ID
------------------------------------------

* Ancient tech dominates (1905 era)
* 15 character strings for caller ID isn't enough
* Caller ID doesn't really work on Mobile - it involves serious hacks
* Users pay around 1 cent per query
* resolving it is **hard**

    * Pricey: Telco negotiating means talking to Executives and very expensive
    * Resources: Tiny community of developers who know CNAM telephony
    * Complex: Based off really weird switches that cache CNAM data without updating
    
* Summary

    * Hacks for mobile
    * Data quality issues
    * Pricey

.. parsed-literal::

    "It's just a string"
    
    -- Every developer, ever
    
How they resolved it
-----------------------

* Figure out how to replace it
* Provide longer Unicode string
* Make it cheap: .04 cents per query (really cheap)
* Encrypt everything
* Provide an API::

    $ curl -H "Accept: application/json" # TODO add rest


Tools
-------

* Flask

    * Fast
    * Under 1000 lines of code so they know it's stable
    * Lots of good libraries for it
    
* AWS

    * Dynamic scaling
    * DynamoDB

        * Similar to MongoDB, at least as fast and much more stable
        * Really, really fast
        
            * **In their case** it's 2500% (25x) faster than PostgreSQL if you are in the Amazon Datacenter
            * DynamoDB is so fast in their case it's faster than using MemcachedD
  
        * Reliable (data replicated across data centers)
        * 

* Heroku

    * Simple to get started
    * Reliable (99.99%)
    
* PostgreSQL

    * Via Heroku can scale up as needed
    * Use read-slaves to increase for performance
    
* Stripe
* BitPay for BitCoin
    
Method - SOA
--------------

* They broke up the project into a bunch of components

    * API service (handles telephony)
    * Accounts App (user authentication)
    * Website app (public facing site)
    
* Benefits

    * Developers can focus on individual components
    * If one part breaks, the other parts will still function
    
Flask Libraries they used
------------------------------------

* dynamodb-mapper

    * Replicates ORM functionality
    * Pretty fast
    
* flask-login

    * Handles authentication
    * flask-login decorator

Marketing
----------

* You don't need marketers
* Use this formula

    * Google your industry
    * Find your customers
    * Put names, urls, and emails into a google docs
    * Email 3 customers per day, asking for feedback
    * Listen to feedback

Selling: xCNAM
----------------

A better protocol for Called ID

* 100 character Unicode string
* CNAM Storage product
* Make it faster
* Make it cheaper


The Role and Representation of Python in the Online Educational Boom
========================================================================

By Justin Hampton

Background
------------

* First distance learning system was proposed in 1892!
* In the 1970s correspondence education picked up with television lectures



The Future is in the Headlights
----------------------------------

* Modular vs. Linear
* Personalized vs. Generic
* Distributed vs. Localized
* Accessible vs. Elite

... but we're not there yet.

What we have today
--------------------------

* MOOCS: Massive Open Online Courses (e.g. Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, EDX, etc)
* DIY courses: (hackerspaces, Maker Fair)
* Peer-to-peer Learning Exchanges (Meetups, PyCons, et al)
