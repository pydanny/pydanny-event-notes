February 22, 2012 - 12 Factor App 
==========================================

* by Craig Kersteirns of Heroku

Where we've been
================

* Version control

    * folders
    * cvs/svn
    * git/mercurial

* Dependency Management

    * `python setup.py install`
    * `easy_install somepackage`
    
* Deployment

    * rsync myproject runserver
    * scp

Where we're going
===================

* Modern Version Control makes it possible to:

    * 1 code base with many deploys 
    
* Dependency Management

    * `pip install somepackage`
    * `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

* Deployment

    * Capistrano
    * Tarball
    * slug
    * Bundle everything together so rollbacks are trivial
    
What is 12 Factor?
==================

A set of practices used by Heroku that serves as a mantra as to what they are doing.

* Declarative Setup - Minimize setup time
* Clean contracts - Portability to run anywhere
* Deploy practices - Cloud and horizontal scaling
* Minimize Divergence - Continuous Deployment

Dev/Prod Parity
================

* Dev = Staging = Prod
* sqlite != postgres = postgres

.. warning:: Don't use sqlite in dev or you get screwed! This happened to me!

Config
======

Don't do this::

    $ ls
    settings.py
    prod-settings.py
    dev-settings.py
    local-settings.py        
    
This is fail:

.. sourcecode:: python

    # settings.py
    from local_settings import *
    
Or this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    # settings/prod.py
    from base import *



Do this instead:

.. sourcecode:: python

    # settings.py
    MY_SETTING = os.environ.get("MY_SETTING")

Concurrency
===========

* Don't worry about languages/frameworks being able to scale.
* Better to let the server side handle it. 
* Use worker processes

Logs
====

We use logs thus::

    $ tail -f access_log

How we percieve logs::

    $ ls
    access_log
    error_log
    
But when it comes down to it, logs are really an event stream:

* Imagine if logs were aggregated into one stream
* Then you can filter out the parts you want
* Order things the way you want
