* Hangs out in Glendale while waiting to go back to the UK.
* Just migrated a shop off of custom virtualization to EC2.
* See http://www.memrise.com/dev/

Basics
--------

* Why another management framework?

    * Wanted to be up and running quickly.
    * Wasn't familiar with Chef, Puppet, or even cfengine.
    * Was very familiar with sysadmin, Python, boto, and EC2


Starting instances
--------------------

Let's start a backup database server::

    $start_instance web web99
    
This will:

    * Create new instance of the "database" type
    * Give it the host name db10.memrise.com
    * Install MySQL 5.5 from source
    * Install our custom .cnf
