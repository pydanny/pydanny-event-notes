Amazonian Fabric
==================

* Hangs out in Glendale while waiting to go back to the UK.
* Just migrated a shop off of custom virtualization to EC2.
* See http://www.memrise.com/dev/

.. note:: Good talk about patterns and techniques but I'm having trouble keeping up with switching to slides and code non-stop.

Basics
--------

* Why another management framework?

    * Wanted to be up and running quickly.
    * Wasn't familiar with Chef, Puppet, or even cfengine.
    * Was very familiar with sysadmin, Python, boto, and EC2


Starting instances
--------------------

Let's start a backup database server::

    $start_instance web web99
    
This will:

    * Create new instance of the "database" type
    * Give it the host name db10.memrise.com
    * Install MySQL 5.5 from source
    * Install our custom .cnf
    
Instance Types
-----------------

EC2 Instance Types and AMIs are configured using the... (lost the slide content here)

Control Server
----------------

* "Master" server for running other servers and tracking state.
* Issue: Another system to maintain
* Very good at getting out of sync with running systems.

Deployment in Parallel
-----------------------

The ``fabric`` command for deployments now can:

    * Fund the host types that should be deployed to
    * Run common global deployment code once
    * Run common deployment code across all servers in parallel
    * Update the load balancer

Building Role Lists
--------------------

* Create lists of each server type using instance_type metadata and instance state
* Add ssh username and port
* Cache results to speed repeated calls

Scaling Web Servers
---------------------

* Can't use EC2 Elastic Cloud Service because of metrics
* Will often know in advance when load spikes will occur
* Want to make adding and removing capacity very easy
