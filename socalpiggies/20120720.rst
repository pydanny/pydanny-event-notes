What is Redis?
================

* In-memory database/data structure server

    * Limited to main memory; vm and diskstore defunct
    
* Persistence via snapshot or append-only file
* Support for master/slave replication (multiple slaves and slave chaining supported)

    * No master-master, don't even try. In other words, if you have two masters running on the same system, you'll have serious, major, painful issues.
