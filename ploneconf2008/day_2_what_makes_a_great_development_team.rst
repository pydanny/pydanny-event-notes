What is the problem?
====================

From the customer's point of view
---------------------------------

- Its expensive
- Its not what they wanted
- Its unpredictable

From the development team's point of view
-----------------------------------------

- Its mentally hard
- Don't feel appreciated for their smarts
- It is hard work and the hours are often long, inconsistently hard
- The business doesn't know what they want
    
Requirements
------------

- Sometimes not technical enough
- Sometimes too technical
    
Process is not the answer
-------------------------

- More control eats up engineer team
    
Technology is not the answer
----------------------------

- Traditional or service doesn't answer

Tools are not the answer
------------------------

- trac is not the answer

People are the answer
---------------------

- Great people are what you want
- Great people need process, technology, tools

Different process methods
-------------------------

- Pick the one you want, it doesn't matter
- Principles and ethics are what is important
- Values of the developer

What Mike Robinson thinks will work
===================================

People
-------

- Change

    - Requirements will shift
    - Scope will migrate
    - Don't think what you know will always work
    - Technology mutates over time
    - The market changes
    - Embrace change!
    - Work in such a way that change does not kill you
    
        - Think like a sculptor in that you refine things over time
        - Simplicity is king!  If you start complex, it will be harder to enhance later

- Quality!

    - Do things right
    - Testing early, often, well
    - Are you building the right solution to a problem?
    - Get feedback

- Commitment

    - Everyone has to be committed
    - Give them sense ownership
    - Make developers feel like what they are doing will make a difference

- Visibility

    - Let people see what you are doing
    - Give constant status updates
    - Metrics are really important
    - You are either not started, started, or done.  No statements of percentage completes!  No more 90% or 75%

- Collaboration

    - Get your people into feeling they are part of the team.  
    - That includes developers, managers, testers, etc

- Focus on Value

    - People need to be told what is considered to be of value
    - Developers need to be instructed as to what parts of what they do will be shown to have value
    - Got to see why what you are doing is important
    - If its not of any use, why do something?

----

Process
--------

- How do you pick the right process for your time?

    - No one process is good for all teams.
    - Based on values of your effort, pick the simplest approach to process for your team

- Review and adapt your process to see if it needs to be altered
- Evolve your process as needed

Conclusion
