Day 2 - Agile Process
============================

by Mike Robinson

Introduction
==============================

- Agile is a conceptual framework
- Agile does have documentation
- Agile methods have been around since the 1990s and were united by the agile manifesto.
- Agile empowers the workers
- Agile knows their finished when they are finished
- Agile is:

    - Like driving a race car, you know the course but can't account for all the variables
        
Agile Values
----------------

- Individuals and interactions  > process and tools
- Working software              > comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration        > contract negotiation
- Responding to change          > following a plan
- Planning is more important than plans
    
Agile Principles
----------------

- **Highest priority is to satisfy the customer**
- **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.  Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
- **Deliver working software frequently**.  90% completion is a lie.  Its either not started, working, or finished.  If you do not deliver working software you are of no value.
- Business people and developers must **work together** daily 
- Build projects over **motivated people**
- Give developers the support they need and trust them to **get the job done**
- **Working software is the primary measure of growth.**
- Information is best done in **face-to-face conversation**
- Agile processes promote **sustainable development** by not overworking people to meet deadlines.  
- The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain constant speed**. 
- **Simplicity** is really awesome.  Code is a liability to any organization.  The less code you can deliver the better.
- The best architecture, requirement, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
- At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective, then **adjusts its behavior accordingly**.
    
Why use agile?
------------------------

- Agile lets you meet what the marketing folks want to give to customers
- Agile means good for business so you can plan out hours better
- Operations likes it because your updates are simpler
- Development likes it because it empowers developers

Developers need to be respected
-------------------------------

- Don't agree on schedules without developer input
- Don't agree on tasks without developer input
- Developers need to be honest in describing what needs to be done
- Get developers to demo their work to the customer!
    
Charging for the assessment phase
------------------------------------

- Bill for it
- Tell customers that you'll bill for planning as long as the customer is willing to pay
    
Roles on a team
------------------------------

- Product owner: Drives the project
- Project Manager: Handles the resources
- Team: Developers
- Stakeholders: Customers
- Users: obvious
    
Artifacts
------------

- Impediment list (use stickies on the wall to be obvious)
- Project iteration
- Working code
    
Agile requirements analysis, estimating and planning
--------------------------------------------------------

- Identify the users

    - Gather requirements from the users via
    
        - Interviews
        - Questionnaires
        - Observation
        - workshops
        
    - Ways of documenting

        - Use cases fixed the ATM returning cards after cash

            - too big to plan for and measure with
            - prone to include UI details

        - User stories
        
            - a tiny bit of information.
            - You can attach these to use cases

    - Estimating development

        - Prediction is difficult!
        - You will never be 100% accurate
        - Short efforts on estimates are accurate
        - Long efforts on estimates are always off
        - Breakdown tasks into manageable chunks
        - Estimation performed by development team
        - Deriving an estimate

            - Expert opinion
            - Analogy
            - Planning poker

        - Story points are a relative measure of size of a story.  10 points is more than 5.
        - Ideal time it would take to complete a task without interruptions.  A football game is 60 ideal minutes and 120 minutes with interruptions
        
    - Planning poker
    
        - Each member gets six cards
        - People put the value they think it will take down on the table.  The most common value is how long it will take in story points.
        - If one person has things way off, then talk out why there is a discrepancy
        - After each task has point assigned, figure out how long a point is worth.  Use previous effort to determine the length of a story point.
        
    - Prioritizing user stories
    
        - Priority assignment is the primary responsibility of the Product Owner
        
    - Velocity
    
        - Measure the rate of progress of a team
        - Amount of story points completed in the last iteration
        - Next iteration = same as last iteration ("yesterday weather")
        - velocity corrects estimation error
        - Accommodate developer optimism
        - Burndown chart
        
            - Plots the amount of committed effort left against the time left to complete the iteration
