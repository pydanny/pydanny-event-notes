Lego sets - Starter projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pinax is **NOT** just for social networks

zero project = directory layout, static files, deployment
static project = zero project + static serve
account project = zero project + account + mailer + uniform
company project = zero project + blog
basic project = account project + profiles + notification + announcements
private beta project = account project + restricted access + waiting list + signup codes
intranet project = basic project + restricted access + top level content apps (wiki, attachments, tasks, etc)
code project = basic project + projects + group-based content apps (wiki, attachments, tasks, etc)
friends project = basic project + friends + invitations
social project = friends project, blogs, microblogging, usert-to-user messages + LOTS

The Trade off
=============

How much to fix
how much to make configurable


Pinax IS Django
===============

Django doesn't hide python and Pinax doesn't hide Django.
Pinax is even more opinionated about Django
