Technical Talk
-----------------

.. note:: @jacobian pointed me out and embarrassed me so I didn't finish copying out his sphinx example.

Sphinx is awesome::

    .. code-block:: html+django
        
Useful Sphinx stuff for authentication-protected static files:

    * **static**: http://lukearno.com/projects/static
    * **barrel**: http://lukearno.com/projects/barrel    
    
These sorts of integrated components are an incredible indicator of some of the awesomeness of Python

State of Django Talk
---------------------

* Django is doing very well
* Each release has more and more incredible stuff added.
* "Always feels like we are not moving as fast as we should, but when you look at what's been accomplished it's amazing. Especially since forward compatibility has been pretty well maintained."
* Django 1.5 should give us

    * Python 3 support
    * Composite keys
    
Celebration
-----------

* This year has seen a ridiculous amount of adoption for Django.
* There is no longer an industry where Django does not exist.
