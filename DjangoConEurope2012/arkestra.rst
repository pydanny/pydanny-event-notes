.. note:: Good talk but some slides had too many bullets. 

What typically happens when working with a CMS
==========================================================

* You have to repeat yourself
* data gets wasted and lost
* content & presentation becomes inconsistent
* info in templates gets broken and petrifies
* information ages, withers & dies
* users play fast & loose
* The larger the site the worse the problems get

His idea
=========

Create a model of the real world

Informtation, not just data
==============================

* information not useless stupid data
* templates don't hold information
* Semantic modeling  real-world relationships
* user semantics!

Organization
============

* Can you model a CMS based off an organization?
* He created a concept of ``entity``
* Many interconnections of content and data
* He did it on http://medicine.cf.ac.uk
* We did a very similar effort on http://science.nasa.gov/, but...

    * not so well organized.
    * grown organically during the course of a number of badly run meetings
