What typically happens when working with a CMS
==========================================================

* You have to repeat yourself
* data gets wasted and lost
* content & presentation becomes inconsistent
* info in templates gets broken and petrifies
* information ages, withers & dies
* users play fast & loose
* The larger the site the worse the problems get

His idea
=========

Create a model of the real world

Informtation, not just data
==============================

* information not useless stupid data
* templates don't hold information
* Semantic modeling  real-world relationships
* user semantics!
