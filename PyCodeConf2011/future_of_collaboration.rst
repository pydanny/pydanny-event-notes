The Future of Collaboration - Daniel Greenfeld
==============================================

Intro
=====

Danny cartwheels, still blogs, works on Django Packages and whitespacejobs.org

Mark Pilgrim is gone

* feedparser, httplib2, Dive into Python, Dive into HTML5
* How much did we lose with Mark leaving the developer community?
* kennethreitz created a mirror at https://github.com/diveintomark

Where is httplib2?

* PyPI? No
* Not Google code
* Hard to find cached download
* Many libraries depend on it

Repeating history?

* django-piston, python.org, opencomparison.org all have bus factor and need active maintenance

Dark future?
============

* Critical Python packages vanish
* Build scripts fail
* Can't always replace from caches/backups
* Legacy projects unmaintainable
* Domain knowledge leaves
* Hard to move forward
* 3rd party community as critical as core
* Actually, this is not the future. It's today

Like the Library of Alexandria

* When we lose our history, we lose ourselves

Trust issues
============

* External and internal social issues
* Makes collaboration hard
* Causes "Not Invented Here" plague

Solutions?
==========

Sponsorships

* But focused on short-term development, unusable code from interns
* Server costs are not the issue

Community managers

* Needs core/senior devs
* They're busy
* Volunteers have different priorities

Paid community managers

* Work with package authors/maintainers
* Mitigate social issues
* Precedence: Ubuntu, Fedora, Twilio, Github

How do we keep Python's community projects active?

* PSF project incubation: YC-style seed funding
* Helping market projects via python.org, blogs, other channels
* Help community projects find a business model, sustain themselves
* Copy startup model for projects that benefit Python
