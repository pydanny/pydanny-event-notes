* project is 'ramen profitable'

1. Start off on the Right Foot
==============================

* Have a good amount of money in hand to lesson stress
* Be in good health
* Relationships in good shape
* Quit your job cause you can't do this as a side project

Redefine success
----------------

* Don't try to beat google
* Make your goals modest
* Small goals to begin with

I know HTML! I can program!
----------------------------

* Started in Computer Science but graduated Graphic Design
* Joined a startup as the Designer that grew into a medium sized company
* Got bored
* Wanted to do something that could impact the world

Tried to find a co-founder
------------------------------

* Why weddings?
* Work on something you love to work on
* Cofounders are awesome, but no cofounder is better than the wrong cofounder
* Things didn't go well with the cofounder didn't go well

Did it herself
---------------

* Learn Python The Hard Way (Zed Shaw) **Great programming starter book**
* Got recommended to use Django because of so many apps available 
* Launched weddinglovely.com in 6 weeks!

2. Launch as fast as possible
================================

* Don't try to build giant from the start
* Easy to get discourage
* Everything is going to change once you launch - you can't predict the direction of things
