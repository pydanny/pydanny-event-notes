What he does
=============

 * PSF board member
 * Pycon chair
 * Python core dev
 * Dad, developer
 
What is Python?
==================

 * Language
 * Community
 * PyPy, PyPI
 * Heroku: http://bit.ly/o73sOR

    * Humble community - no rockstar personas 
    * Approachable
    * etc
    
Where is Python used?
========================

    * Disney Animation Studios
    * NASA
    * Many other things
    * Too many cool places to list
    * Python is everywhere
    * Everyone uses Python
    
Python is amazing
====================

 * Easy to learn
 * Easy to use
 * Very fast
 * Large scale, small scale
 
Status of the Language
========================

 * Approx 123 accepted PEPS
 * about 80 Built-in functions
 * 250+ stdlibs
 * Python 2.7.x is last of the 2.X series
 * How about status of http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/?
 
    * Windows installer for Windows
    * I don't use Windows, but my students usually do
    
Jesse's Personal Wishlist
========================

 * Better messaging systems
 * Actor support in stdlib
 * Support for gevent and other things

Jesse says we need
====================

 * More Pythonic APIs (mentions Kenneth Reitz)
 * ...to remain conservative in changing the language too much
 * ...but adding to the stdlib is a problem
 
    * Barely fits in the head
    * stdlib stalls things

PyPy!
======

 * Super-fast
 * Gets things done
 * A bit complex - needs people like Alex Gaynor to do the work
 * Doesn't handle cpython stuff that touches C stuff.
 * predictions:
 
    * Will be used more and more
    * Will continue to be based off the cpython implementation
    
Python interpeters
=========================

 * Need to work together, tests, compatibility, etc
 * BFFs:
 
    * PyPy
    * CPython
    * Jython
    * IronPython
    
Python 3
========

 * Keep calm and carry on
 * Python is 21 years old, a 5 year plan to migrate to it is nothing
 * Python 3 porting is getting finding
 * The PSF is willing to give out grants

Community
=========

 * Look at the number of Python conferences!
 * I got mentioned by Jesse! Yeah!
