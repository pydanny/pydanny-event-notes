 * All documentation sucks because the mind of the writer can't match the mind of the reader
 * Use cases mostly appear to be "I want to know about X"

Use cases
============

 * Documentation wasn't necessarily done with use cases in mind
 
Images and pictures!
======================

 * No pictures? **A picture is worth a thousand words**
 * Some people need visual pictures to process things - visual thinkers

No jokes?
===========

 * Jokes cut through barriers and allow people to interact more intimately
 * Humor negates fear
 * But you run the risk of looking silly
