=======

 * All documentation sucks because the mind of the writer can't match the mind of the reader
 * Use cases mostly appear to be "I want to know about X"

Use cases
============

 * Documentation wasn't necessarily done with use cases in mind
 
Images and pictures!
======================

 * No pictures? **A picture is worth a thousand words**
 * Some people need visual pictures to process things - visual thinkers

No jokes?
===========

 * Jokes cut through barriers and allow people to interact more intimately
 * Humor negates fear
 * But you run the risk of looking silly

Problem: overview
============================

 * google "django overview" https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/overview/

    * shouldn't a glance be visual?
    * Gigantic document
   
Problem: Tutorial   
====================
    
    * Put your apps in project subdirectories
    * It's like they'd never heard of the Python PATH
    * manage.py startapp *still* does it that way.
    
Problem: SEO optimization
=========================
 
    * Why isn't the first Google hit on every 'django' somewhere in the docs
    * Problem: Curious noob gets odd things
    * django users doesn't return good results
    
Problem: People might get smug about Django docs
===========================================================================

 * Because they have become smug

Solutions
===========

 * Make documentation submissions process easier
 * Ask for all doc submissions and reserve the right to edit
