How did Django get started?
============================

 * 2002 - 2003 LJ World hired Adrian Holovaty to become their dedicated Web Developer
 
 * Previous to 2002 had Frank Wiles making things for them in Perl
 * Adrian hired Simon Willison as the most overqualified intern until Alex Gaynor
 * Because of the fast news cycle at a newspaper you don't have the luxuries of other jobs.
 * Sometimes you have to build a project within 24 hours
 * Adrian and Simon decided to do it all in Python
 * The Python ecosphere didn't have all the tools they needed so they made things up
 
    * Zope/Plone couldn't cut it
    * No light frameworks existed
    
 * At PyCon 2005 they went to a success story workshop and Adrian demonstrated a blog in 5 minutes

    * Nothing else in Python could do it at the time
    * People asked them to open source it
    * LJ World was okay with open sourcing it
    
 * In July 2005 they released it as open source


Why did Django get traction and other light Python frameworks didn't?
====================================================================================

 * Luck of timing
 * They did a lot more documentation than any other emerging option
