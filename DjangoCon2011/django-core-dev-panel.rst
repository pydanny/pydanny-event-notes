Talking on django-dev
=======================

 * be decent
 * Don't just `+1` or `-1` that doesn't give them any knowledge
 * Explain why you are sharing your opinion

Code of conducts
================

 * JKM: Django community ought to have a written code of conduct
 * The Django core dev leadership is very approachable

How can the Django third-party ecosphere be managed?
====================================================

 * Miguel Araujo wanted to know if we can manage the community of third-party world. Cause some packages are just unmaintained
 * Possible ideas:
 
    * unmaintained code could fall out of ownership
    * How do you maintain/control a community of volunteer projects?
    * Core devs are already overloaded
    * The DSF can give Django Packages and other projects more support
