* Started with prose 
* I come to bury Python, not to praise it
* "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." - Fred Brooks
* "Over the centuries native Americans came up with sign languages. Developers have a zillion languages" - Alan
* "Systematically identify top designers as early as possible" - Fred Brooks on getting a software architect in place
* **Give in to your hate** - Glyph on hating things that aren't Python
