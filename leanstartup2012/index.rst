* If you are building a startup you are trying to replace the big companies you dislike. The big companies started the same way you did, as a way to break the current system.

* We want to build the next big companies by mastering the disciplines of entrepreneurship.

Todd Park - USA CTO
===================

* https://twitter.com/todd_park
* Previous - CTO of Health and Human Services
* Current: - U.S. Chief Technology Officer and Assistant to the President. Tech entrepreneur-in-residence at the White House
* Worked a medical startup in Boston that went public in 2006
* Created two more health based companies in Boston

Work
----

* Often runs startup-like efforts called 'entrepreneurs in residence' inside the USA, which allows radical new approaches for the federal government
* The FDA has been working with this program to help the health of the nation.

Open Data Initiatives Program
------------------------------

* URL: http://www.data.gov
* Ronald Reagan is the godfather of the 'Open Data Initiatives Program'!
* GPS grew out of this system which has provided billions of dollars of business
* The government is the holder of immense archives of useful data

.. note:: Sunlight Labs (http://sunlightlabs.com/) is a group that works to translate the often **not-machine** readable data into formats that can be read and used by machines (and hence entrepreneurs).

Todd is working on...
-------------------------------

* See RFPEZ to get through government RFPs faster (find on GitHub)
* Getting your health records from the US government without pain.
* US Government runs 24,000 websites. How are they all done? How much replication happens?
* US government spends $80 billion on IT per year. Needs to be cheaper! Use open source and better IT companies!

.. note:: This is why OpenStack (http://www.openstack.org) was started at NASA by Chris Kemp. It was to reduce cost of single server setup from tens of thousands of dollars (mostly labor costs for meetings to discuss setting up single machines) to the same cloud costs paid for Amazon AWS. I can tell you as an ex-NASA employee that server provisioning was overly expensive as of 2010.

Diane Tavenner - Summit Public Schools
=======================================

* http://www.summitps.org/
* Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of SPS

Issues
--------

* PROS: Lots of successes! Tons of High School graduates!
* CONS: Only 50% of their graduates finished their college degrees
* Something is wrong

MVP concept
-----------

* What if instead of teachers directing classrooms, students went down their own path
* While this is not a new concept, they decided to map out the requirements extremely clearly to students and parents.
* They created an on-line testing system so that students could update their status by passing tests so they could see the results instantly.
* Added tons of testing and metrics. Rather than wait for years for results, they needed to know right away so they could fix it.
* Refused to use vanity metrics to promote the schools. They needed to know honest, real data on actual results - and kept even the bad news.
* Encouraged teens to provide feedback through mechanisms that teens like to use.

What they discovered
---------------------

* Lectures were not effective. 
* Teachers were much more effective dealing with individual student issues, rather than just broadcasting knowledge.

Get Out of the Building
-----------------------

* Get out and talk to users
* Get Uncomfortable
* Learn quickly and upfront if people actually want/need your idea implemented
* If you don't ask you miss out on what they really want.

10 pragmatic ways to get out of the building
----------------------------------------------

1. **Don't Ask Your Uncle.** In other words, don't ask people you know will say nice things.
2. **Set up a booth, do a public demo**
3. **Interview potential customers.**
4. **Put your office where your customers are**
5. **Throw a party**
6. **Talk to experts in the field**
7. **Find the decision maker** (everyone else is just chaff)
8. **Listen to what customers are demanding**
9. **Pre-order, landing pages, analytics** (show demand for the product)
10. **Ask for the introduction**

.. note:: Idea: Market your tech startup by sitting in a coffee shop and showing people.

TWO PEOPLE - Eric Reis and Tereza Nemessanyi 
============================================

* Tereza Nemessanyi (https://twitter.com/TerezaN)
* Talking about using general accounting practices.
* Stay away from vanity metrics, except for what goes into a pitch deck.
* Investors use vanity metrics to make investments in your project, but using them for concrete business decision making is dangerous.
* Issue: Investors often use your original vanity metrics when determining how well your project is doing
