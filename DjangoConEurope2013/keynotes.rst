Hard to tell how things worked out
------------------------------------

* Planets move slowly across the sky
* Retrograde motion
* Didn't make sense, so Ptolomy came up with a sophisticated way of handling this based off of observations.
* People followed this for thousands of years because it matched empirical evidence.
* It was the lack of evidence against Ptolomy that made the case against Galileo.
