First Keynote: On the Revolutions
=================================

* by Brandon Rhodes

Topic: Nichola Kopernik
------------------------

* Polish Astronomer
* Lifted the **Earth** into the **heavens**, rather than the Earth was at the bottom of the heavens.
* Lived:


Near-Earth environment
-------------------------

* 300s BC - Aristotle - spherical Earth
* 200s BC - Erathosthenes - radius of Earth
* 100s BC - Hipparchus - distance to Moon

Hard to tell how things worked out
------------------------------------

* Planets move slowly across the sky
* Retrograde motion
* Didn't make sense, so Ptolomy came up with a sophisticated way of handling this based off of observations.
* People followed this for thousands of years because it matched empirical evidence.
* It was the lack of evidence against Ptolomy that made the case against Galileo.

Kopernik debated Ptolomy
-------------------------

Kopernik read:

* Galileo
* Kepler's ellipses
* Newton theories

Bradley in 1725 proved Kopernik
-----------------------------------

* Stellar aberration
* Speed of light
* Watched the stars move in relation to the Earth's movement

.. note::

    "It took 1,900 years after the Greeks discovered the distance to the moon for us to determine the distance to a star." -- Brandon Rhodes

Why did Kopernik debate all the physical evidence for the Earth-centric universe?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Beauty
* Wanted better math
* Made the code pretty

.. note::

    "Kopernik made the most awesome code refactor in history."  -- Brandon Rhodes

Kopernik's model of the solar system made it clear that the Sun was the center of the solar system instead of yet another object.

TODO - get Brandon's code models for the Ptolomic and Kopernik solar system models.

Copernican Refactor
--------------------

Brandon's new term for any refactor that brings things to the center.

Example: Gadgets that combine automobile cigarette lighters with a USB connector to put power into mobile devices.

* Clean Architecture (http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
* Docopt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docopt)
* Django (compared to Python CGI)

Closing
--------

If your code is driving you crazy, think like Kopernik and turn the world upside down.


Second Keynote: Why Django Is Awesome
======================================

* by Daniel Greenfeld aka "Pydanny"

Background
-----------

* Principal at Cartwheel Web
* Co-author of Two Scoops of Django (https://django.2scoops.org)
* Fiance of Audrey Roy :)

Why Django is Awesome
----------------------

Django Is Everywhere
--------------------

NASA, PBS, Instagram, etc.

Django Lets Us Use Python
--------------------------

Python is awesome!

* Python has Zen
* Python has a style guide
* And indentation and such

Django Has Awesome APIs
-----------------------

Requests is known for having an elegant API. Look at sample code from using the Django test client. It's practically the same code!

* Example of models and model methods

API conventions encourage clean design:

* Make it easy to separate content from presentation
* Helps us get things done

Django Views are Functions
-----------------------------

Function views are very simple. ``Request -> Response``

Even with class-based views, you have ``View.as_view()`` which is basically the same thing.

Django Has Awesome Features
-----------------------------

* The admin is what we're known for. Aka "How to sell Django 101".
* Shortest admin module possible in 3 lines.

    * Don't hack the admin to force it to bend to NoSQL. Write separate code
    * Pydanny will be sprinting on django-admin2

Django's Full Stack Is Awesome
-------------------------------

* Dominates hackathons because you have everything in one place
* Building companies is easy with stock Django/Python. Even if you don't understand the larger Django ecosystem, you can get amazing things done with it.

Django Is Part of an Ecosystem
-------------------------------

* 30,000 packages on PyPI
* 1,750 packages on https://www.djangopackages.com/

Django Sets the Bar for Documentation
--------------------------------------

* In the Python world, no one says "just read the code" anymore.
* Largely because of Django

Django's Community is the Best
-------------------------------

* Humble and listens to criticism
* The more you help people in the community, the more the community helps you. Case study: book had over 125 contributors. We gave free copies and asked the community to do nice things in return. Huge response: readers volunteered their time to write Django projects for churches, schools, other good deeds around the world.

Call To Action
---------------

Be awesome. "**I want us to change the world.**" Use your knowledge of Django to help people and do good things.
