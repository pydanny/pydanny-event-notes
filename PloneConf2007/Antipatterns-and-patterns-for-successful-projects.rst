.. note:: I had hoped to get new things out of this but as an experienced US government software contractor, none of this was new. (Danny 07/05/2011)

Introduction (Why should we care)?
====================================

- Any website project is a 'software' project
- All projects are CMS projects

  - Users always want to update the site
  - Types of People involved in development
  
    - User
    
      - Works to get tool to address my needs
      - Tool should be easy to use
      - critical: does not want to change their habits
      
    - Project Manager
    
      - Speaks with user
      - speaks with developer
      -  then manages the budget
      
    - Developer
    
      - Tries to get the right stuff involved: CMS, DMS, Web 2.0, Flex, AJAX, JavaFX, Python, Ruby, .NET, etc...
      - Trying hard to get best CMS done right!
      
    - Success depends on the three parties working together
    - Challenge is that each party has their own priorities
    - Tip one: Try to understand each other
    - User should be put first, since funding and interest comes from them

Follow these rules so life is easier
====================================

- Avoid things that don't work (anti-patterns)

  - Don't reinvent the wheel and fight people who do this sort of thing
  
    - File servers, DMS, Mail Server, Calendars, security, LDAP
    
  - If you build it they will come
  
    - What problem are your trying to address?
    - Have others done it already?
    - I there a third party tool that already exists for this task?
    - Am I building the solution for me, my customer, or my ego?
    - Trap: Gas Factory
    
      - Bloatware
      - We tend to add feature after feature until the application becomes unmanageable

 - Apply rules and patterns that work
