* Bag of Words
* English

Techniques
------------

* Semantic Summation
* Machine learning classification

Pre-processing
--------------

* Unrepeat (His description of long terms like `sweeeeeet`)
* Entity Extraction (Pulling out nouns/entities from text have to not skew the results. For example: Fight against **evil** can make a positive description sound bad)
* Tokenization

    * Problem: Abbreviations
    * Problem: Emoticons

* Spell correct http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
* Word stopping
* Limitization

    * Reduce word to it's root form
    * Result is a word
    * Running => Run

* Stemming

    * Reduce word to a stem
    * May not be a word
    * Carry => Cari
