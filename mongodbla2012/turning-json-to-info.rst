========================
Turning JSON into info
========================

by Roger Bodamer

.. note:: Did not show the query code. I have to look it up online. Ugh.

Relative Queries
=================

* 2 aggregations at the same time

    * 1 by user
    * 1 by location

* Break up into several queries
* Fairly complex
* Easiest in Python or other programming languages

A note on queries
==================

* There is no notion of declared schema
* The augmented scheme is coded in queries
* Reuse is very hard, happens at a query language

Dimensions
============
