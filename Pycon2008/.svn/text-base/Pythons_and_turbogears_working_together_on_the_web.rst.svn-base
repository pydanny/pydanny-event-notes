Turbogears Philosophy
=====================
 * grab best of breed items and created framework
 * Replaced Kid with Genshi (faster, more flexible)
 
Why TG2?
========
 * World was moving towards WSGI
 * Pylons was already there and had similar components (SQLAlchemy, Paste, buffet)
 * Make it easier to understand
 * Wanted to get where Pylons was with WSGI
 * Share developer efforts with Pylons
 * WSGI which allows the fun of Middleware and has a well-defined interface
 * WSGI lets you build up your framework from Middleware
 
Why not just merge TG and Pylons?
=================================
 * Pylons likes everything to be independent
 * TG likes standard options to speed things up
 * (Debian != Ubuntu) == (Pylons != TurboGears)

Stuff that was shared
=====================
 * Pylons middleware for exception handling
 * Make a TG style controller in Pylons
 
Going forward with other frameworks
=====================================
 * Maybe lots of frameworks was good
 * Web frameworks need to work better
 * Need to communicate better
 * Biodiversity is the SIGN of a healthy ecosystem
  - Lots of ways to handle different problems like forms and security
 * repoze.tm
 * repoze.profile
 * Stop reinventing the wheel!
 * DBSprockets (django admin for other frameworks!) -- look this up!!!
 * WebOp makes writing middleware easy
 * Social prerequisites
  - Play nice!
  - Respect each other
  - willingness to listen
  - try other frameworks
  - develop a thick skin
