Iterators in action
===================

Overview
========
 * Functional LINQ
 * Recursvie Generators

Functional LINQ
===============
 * LIN primitives
  - Relational Algebra
  - map, reduce reduce
 * Lots of functionality
 * Language INtegrated uery
 * Streaming
 
Row composition
===============
 * __iter__, next
 * All iterators use it
 
Column Composition
===================
 * Colums are harder
 * Fundamental ops in relational algerbra
 
Naming
===============
 * Solution to integration in python is naming
 * namespaces
 
namedtuple
===============
 * Sublcassing the tuple type
 * associated the column names with an index in the tiple
 * part of 2.6 - collections.namedtuple # LOOK THIS UP!!!
 
Select
======
 * write helper functions
 * look up tee - part of itertool.tee
 
operator.itemgetter
===================
 * extracts multiple items from a seuence
 
create join primitives
======================
 * hash_join adding two iters on a defined predicate
 
Research items
==============
 * itertools in general
 * collections.namedtuple
 * collections in general
 
Concepts for use
=================
 * Joining SQl data with other data for mashups
 * Best to convert all data to namedtuples because then you have more finicky control
 
Recursive Generators
====================
 * # cookbook recipe 190465
 * Graph traversal across edges and nodes
 * Workhorse algorythm
 * Bone up on yields again
 
Fork
=====
 * 2.5+
 * Given a generator runs it in a separate thread
 * Look up fork
 
Global Interpreter Lock
=======================
 * Not in cpython or in jython
 * from __future__ import global_interpreter_lock
 * from __future__ import GIL
 * Not going to happen!
